## Teaching

Courses I teach emphasize process- and project-based learning, typically with
students workshopping projects over the course of the term. Classes
feature discussions on (American) novels and introduce students to digital
tools (such as [NYWalker](http://nywalker.newyorkscapes.org)) with which they
can enhance their reading.
