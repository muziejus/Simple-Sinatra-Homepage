## Teaching & Collaboration

My academic work relies on collaboration and process, both in and outside the
classroom. I work best as part of a
team that sees its work as one of experimentation and workshopping towards a
project. For example, recently, a team including myself built [Torn Apart /
Separados](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/torn-apart/), a site that reflects on
the state of immigration in the US in 2018 and was [covered by
_WIRED_](https://www.wired.com/story/ice-is-everywhere-using-library-science-to-map-child-separation/).
This focus on teamwork and process is one I aim to teach to my students, as
well.
