# How to Give a Good Presentation

Presentations are complicated things, but they have to be assessed in some
way. What follows is a set of recommendations and guidelines that also
indicate what I look for when grading presentations.

## General rules

1. **Practice**. This cannot be emphasized enough. If you come into your
   presentation with just a few ideas sketched out on a slip of paper, your
   presentation will likely be garbage. It takes years of presenting and a
   deep, deep sense of your specific topic to be able to wing it. Practice
   provides coherence, which is the fundamental requirement I look for.
2. **Practice**. Seriously, practice is vital. Without practicing, you won’t
   know how long your presentation is. Part of presentation assessment
   considers how you have managed the parameters you have been given.
   Presentations that run short are typically thin on information, while
   those that run long are obnoxious and rude.
3. **Practice**. Can you tell where this is going? Presentations aim to inform
   the audience and extend their knowledge of a topic. With practice, you also
   understand the topic better, meaning you will be better equipped to inform
   and extend.

## Preparing the presentation

While I don’t require that you turn in evidence of the following, its lack
will likely be apparent in your finished presentation.

1. **Know where you’re going**. Presentations require a structure. They are
   intellectual journeys. You are taking us to places where we have never been
   before and telling us things we did not know. As a result, you should know
   where you want the presentation to end up when you start planning it. If
   you are presenting on a specific text, for example, your goals can be that
   we, the listeners, know something about the text.  Note that that doesn’t
   mean you just walk through a text page-by-page.  Articles, for example,
   will typically have an argument or thesis they are trying to describe. I
   look for how you make that thesis clear to your listeners, but without
   knowing that ahead of time, you won’t be able to plot the course.

1. **Make an outline**. Outlines are very useful for structuring things, and if
   your presentation doesn’t spend at least part of its life as an outline,
   it is very likely that your structure will be confusing, meaning we won’t
   be able to reach your destination with you.

1. **Write a paragraph**. Sometimes it helps to just write a paragraph version
   of your presentation. Good paragraphs have a structure, as well, meaning
   you should be able to expand your presentation by just adding more to the
   paragraph.

1. **Think about a script**. It’s a terrible idea to stand at a podium and just
   read. It’s boring, and it implies a lack of preparation. After all, if
   you’ve practiced, then you should be able to make eye contact with your
   audience and *present*, not *read*. I look for a certain level of
   familiarity with the material that allows for presenting. On the other
   hand, a script is useful to have on hand. We all get nervous, and it’s nice
   to have a lifeline. Finding the balance is yet another benefit of practice.

## The slide deck

1. **You probably don’t need a deck**. Presentations existed before
   Powerpoint, and I do not require a slide deck in my assessment. Many
   presentations that I have seen with decks did not benefit at all from the
   deck, and it’s possible that it can even distract to the level of hurting
   the presentation. If you choose to include a deck, I look for decks that
   enhance the presentation.

1. **The deck enhances, not repeats**. Countless presentations I have seen
   repeat this structure: the presenter fills each slide with text and just
   reads the text on the slide. This is repetition. Your deck is there to
   enhance your presentation; it is not the soul of the presentation. In other
   words, if a printout of your deck provides more or less the same
   information as your presentation did, then you did not give a presentation;
   you wrote a paper. 

1. **The deck is not a crutch**. Above, I suggest using a script as a sort of
   lifeline. Your deck, however, should *not* play that role.

1. **The deck is minimal**. I look for slides that are concise. The less on
   each slide, the better. Say you’re presenting an argument that makes three
   related claims, and each claim has a handful of subclaims. The slide
   benefits from just listing the top-level claims. Your voice provides the
   details. If you use a block quote, think about whether that quote deserves
   that much space on the slide. 

1. **The deck is secondary**. Because the deck enhances, it is always
   secondary. It can provide you with opportunities to establish, for example,
   a secondary narrative alongside the main journey you are leading us on.
   The deck serves as an opportunity for you to use a different mode of
   information delivery than your voice. That different mode can supplement the
   information your voice is transferring. This is why pictures work better
   than giant blocks of text on slides. But, again, the pictures should not
   *distract*. Just as the presentation itself informs and extends, the deck
   should also inform and extend.
