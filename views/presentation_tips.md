# How to Give a Good Presentation

Presentations are complicated things, but they have to be assessed in some
way. What follows is a set of recommendations and guidelines that also
indicate what I look for when grading presentations.

## General rules

1. **Practice**. This cannot be emphasized enough. If you come into your
   presentation with just a few ideas sketched out on a slip of paper, your
   presentation will likely be garbage. It takes a lot of practice and a deep,
   deep sense of your topic to be able to wing it.
2. **Practice**. Seriously, practice is vital. Without practicing, you won’t know
   how long your presentation is, and presentations that run short are usually
   imperfect, while presentations that run long are obnoxious and rude.
3. **Practice**. Can you tell where this is going? With practice you further
   understand the topic itself, which will make your presentation more fluid
   and coherent.

## Preparing the presentation

1. **Know where you’re going**. Presentations require a structure. They are
   intellectual journeys. You are taking us to places where we have never been
   before and telling us things we did not know. As a result, you should know
   where you want the presentation to end up when you start planning it. If
   you are presenting on a specific text, for example, your goals can be that
   we, the listeners, know something about the text.

   Note that that doesn’t mean you just walk through a text page-by-page.
   Articles, for example, will typically have an argument or thesis they are
   trying to describe. Making that thesis clear to your listeners is the
   fundamental goal of the presentation, and without knowing that, you won’t
   be able to plot the course.

1. **Make an outline**. Outlines are very useful for structuring things, and if
   your presentation doesn’t spend at least part of its life as an outline,
   it is very likely that your structure will be confusing, meaning we won’t
   be able to reach your destination with you.

1. **Write a paragraph**. Sometimes it helps to just write a paragraph version
   of your presentation. Good paragraphs have a structure, as well, meaning
   you should be able to expand your presentation by just adding more to the
   paragraph.

1. **Think about a script**. It’s a terrible idea to stand at a podium and just
   read. It’s boring, and it suggests a lack of preparation. After all, if
   you’ve practiced, then you should be able to make eye contact with your
   audience and *present*, not *read*. For these reasons, a script is a bad
   idea. But a script is also useful to have on hand. Consider the risks and
   benefits, then.

## The slide deck

1. **You don’t need a deck**. Most presentations I have seen that use a slide
   deck do not benefit at all from the deck. In fact, the deck often makes the
   presentation *worse*. 

1. **The deck is not a crutch**. Above, I suggest using a script as a sort of
   lifeline. We all get nervous, and it’s nice to have something to lean on.
   Your deck, however, should *not* play that role. If the deck is a crutch,
   what happens if there is a technical glitch, and your deck no longer works?
   Your presentation grinds to a halt.

1. **The deck enhances, not repeats**. One of the most common features of a
   deck is that the presenter fills each slide with text and just reads the
   text on the slide. This is a repetition. This is also using the
   presentation as a crutch. Your deck is there to enhance your presentation;
   it is not the soul of the presentation. In other words, if a printout of
   your deck provides more or less the same information as your presentation
   did, then you did not give a presentation; you wrote a paper.

1. **The deck is minimal**. The less on each slide, the better. Outlines help
   with this, of course. Say you’re presenting an argument that makes three
   related claims, and each claim has a handful of subclaims. The slide
   benefits from just listing the top-level claims. Your voice provides the
   details. If you use a block quote, consider if the quote deserves that much
   text on the slide. 

1. **The deck is secondary**. Because the deck enhances, it is always
   secondary. It can provide you with opportunities to establish, for example,
   a secondary narrative alongside the main journey you are leading us on.
   This is, in fact, perhaps the only reason to have a deck. The deck relies
   on a different mode of information delivery than your voice, so that can
   supplement the information your voice is transferring. This is why pictures
   work better than giant blocks of text on slides. But the pictures should
   not *distract*.
