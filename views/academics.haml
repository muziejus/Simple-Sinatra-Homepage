        My scholarly interests lie at the intersection of aesthetic production—specifically the 20th and 21st century American novel—political agency, geography, community, (geospatial) digital humanities, geocrticism, and realism.

          I am currently at work on a project tentatively called *Making
          Maps: Mixed Methods and Everyday Criticism*.

          This project reintroduces the geospatial components of my 
          scholarly interests in the world-making quality of the novel 
          that I left out of my dissertation. There are two aims to this 
          project. The first is to build a mixed methods approach to 
          literary criticism that justifies the use of Geographic 
          Information Systems/Science in analyzing the content of aesthetic
          objects. The second aim is to inhabit this productive means of
          analysis by modeling the methodology in iteratively reading
          and analyzing geographically rich American realist novels of the
          20th and 21st centuries.

          By building, or, better, creatively *making* tools to help analyze
          novels, I engage in a process of production as well as discovery.
          This way I can demonstrate how a small question is posed and
          answered, which then yields new questions. The GIS is tasked with 
          new challenges, and the text enjoys tighter relationships with the 
          reader.

          Making maps, then, serves as an example of what I call “everyday
          criticism,” which is a bottom-up approach to an aesthetic object that
          works with what's at hand that writes a reading from below, by
          making use of, in J. K. Gibson-Graham's words, the “[creativity to
          generate actual possibilities where none formerly
          existed](http://bit.ly/1I7SGsY).”

          The mixed methodology and iterative form of reading I call “everyday criticism”
          lends itself very well to mixing digital tools in a scholar’s literary analysis.
          Everyday criticism is, in fact, the result of trying to solve how to use
          methodologies traditionally denounced as quantitative and/or positivist in
          literary study. As a result, my work is both receptive to and representative
          of the digital humanities—specifically the geospatial digital humanities.

          ### Projects

          I developed the web application, [NYWalker](http://nywalker.newyorkscapes.org),
          to create an interface for quickly and easily geocoding literary objects. It
          has been used in the classroom, in my own research, and is now even being used
          by other researchers, such as [Manan Ahmed](http://history.columbia.edu/faculty/Ahmed.html)’s 
          team in their “Mapping Mughal India
          1500–1600 CE” project at Columbia University.

          *NYWalker* also provides the foundational dataset for my data visualization of
          the tenth episode of James Joyce’s *Ulysses*, 
          “[Fabula and Sjužet in ‘Wandering Rocks.’](https://muziejus.github.io/wandering-rocks)”
          This visualization shows the interpretive and analytical limitations of simply building
          a dataset, another issue that *Map Making* addresses.

          I am also using *NYWalker* in building datasets that will end up driving analysis
          in *Map Making* itself, including a [map of geographical means in Colum McCann’s 
          *Let the Great World Spin*](http://ltgws-maps.herokuapp.com).

          ### Collaboration

          In addition to advising on “Mapping Mughal India 1500–1600 CE,” I am
          also the DH advisor for “[Mapping Expatriate Paris: The Shakespeare
          and Company Lending Library Project](http://mep.princeton.edu),” a
          project directed by Joshua Kotin at Princeton University.

          Furthermore, I am active in two research collectives in New York,
          [NewYorkScapes](http://newyorkscapes.org) at NYU and [Columbia’s
          Group for Experimental Methods in the
          Humanities](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in). These have given me
          opportunities to assist graduate students at both universities as
          well as learn from them. 

          ### Presentations and History

          I was the first graduate student in the humanities at Chicago to
          enroll in the year-long course on geographical information
          systems/science (GIS), and I have tried to use that training where
          possible in my literary analysis. This experience also led to
          invitations to two events funded by the National Endowment of the
          Humanities, the [Institute for Enabling Geospatial
          Scholarship](http://spatial.scholarslab.org/about) at the University
          of Virginia and the workshop [“Visualizing Flow and Movement in the
          Humanities”](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=HD-51228-11)
          at the University of Redlands. At both events, I worked with scholars
          in both digital humanities and GIS to imagine specific applications
          of GIS to humanistic work. 
          
          In April 2014, I presented some of my own work in GIS at the “Telling
          Stories with Maps” seminar at the University of Birmingham’s Digital
          Humanities Hub
          ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz58tmCl8TQ)). Similarly, I
          presided over a special session I developed, “[Geocritical
          Explorations inside the
          Text](http://www.mla.org/program_details?prog_id=344&year=2015),” for
          the 130th Annual MLA Convention in Vancouver ([more
          info](/talks/mla-15-geocritical-explorations-inside-the-text)).

          Since coming to NYU, I have repeatedly presented on my geospatial
          digital work, such as at NYU’s [Center for
          Humanities](http://nyuhumanities.org). I also offered to lead a
          workshop, “Digital Mapping for JavaScript Novices,” at the [NYCDH
          Week 2017](http://dhweek.nycdh.org/), but a freak blizzard led to the
          workshop’s cancellation.

          ### Teaching DH

          For 2016, I designed the course “[The Map of the City That Is This
          Novel](http://moacir.com/courses-nyu/map-city-novel-2016),” a course
          that introduces geospatial digital humanities to undergraduates by,
          first, contextualizing work on the city in general, and then by
          letting students build geodatabases of novels that aim to invigorate
          the city (or neighborhood) as an entity on its own terms. Students
          used *NYWalker* in this class, as well as in the “Writing New York”
          class I co-taught with Thomas Augst.

          I continued teaching the “Digital Literary Studies” sequence later in
          2016 by teaching “[Does It
          Work?](http://moacir.com/courses-nyu/does-it-work),” a course
          designed to introduce both the history of literary criticism and the
          possibilities of digital literary study to undergraduates.

          Both courses realize my underlying position, discussed in *Making
          Maps* as well, that the digital humanities is not a radical break
          from half a century of the practice of literary criticism, but,
          rather, is just another set of methods that gives readers tactical
          flexibility when analyzing literature.

          But it also foregrounds the processes of production, 
          collaboration, and public presentation that I believe are
          pedagogical imperatives that the digital humanities help generate.

          “The Site of the Novel: Objects in American Realism, 1930–1940”
          ([abstract
          pdf](http://moacir.com/pdfs/MoacirPdeSaPereira-dissertation-abstract.pdf))
          is the name of the dissertation I wrote and defended in January 2014
          under the direction of [Lauren
          Berlant](http://english.uchicago.edu/faculty/berlant) and [Kenneth W.
          Warren](http://english.uchicago.edu/faculty/warren). The dissertation
          sits at the intersection of my interests in:

          * **Early 20th century American realist novels**. I am writing
          about James T. Farrell’s *Studs Lonigan* trilogy, John Dos
          Passos’s *U.S.A.*, Ernest Hemingway’s *For Whom the Bell Tolls*,
          and Sinclair Lewis’s *It Can’t Happen Here*. Each work engages
          with radical and communist politics of the early 20th century.

          * **(Human) geography and quantitative literary criticism**. All
          these works are very closely attached to the real world, and I have
          been able to collect data about the geographies constructed in the
          worlds of the novels. Using techniques from GIS and approaching the
          works geographically / spatially drew out questions about more
          fundamental ways in which the novel works.

          * **Belonging and community**. The works I investigate feature human
          characters that often blend into their surroundings, either becoming
          part of a larger human community or hanging together as part of a
          larger site of human and nonhuman objects.

          * **Realism as a literary genre and realism as a philosophical
          ontology**. As the notions of individual (or character) and community
          (of objects) become more and more inter-related while still
          independent, it becomes impossible to maintain a human-centric,
          correlationist account of the worlds within literature.

          * **Non-scalar and affective accounts of relations**. Entities like
          communities, characters and their surroundings become considerable as
          proper “sites,” with their own internal relationships that can be
          occasionally rhythmically stratifying and occasionally unpredictably
          deterritorializing, reforming the object of the site. As the
          component objects keep agitating each other they imply from another
          direction the necessity of a non-human, site-based literary
          criticism.

          * **Metonymy and chronotopes**. A non-human, site-based literary
          criticism forces humans, characters, texts, worlds in texts, and the
          like into a heteroglottic cacophony of objects—all real, all
          metonymically (as opposed to metaphorically) connected. Furthermore,
          the worlds in novels are chronotopically connected to the worlds in
          which the novels are written, as the author and reader are both
          influenced by the specific chronotopes of their own sites.

          * **Counterfactual worlds and alternatives to neoliberalism**. The
          specific chronotopes of the novels influence the worlds in which they
          exist as well, meaning every realist novel permits, in J. K.
          Gibson-Graham’s
          [words](http://law.uvic.ca/demcon/victoria_colloquium/documents/gibson_2008_progress_paper.pdf),
          the “creativity to generate actual possibilities where none formerly
          existed.” Every novel, hence, is a box of revolutionary building
          blocks.

        :markdown
          Beyond what gets sufficient coverage in my dissertation, there are a
          wider set of interests that circulate around those key themes. I keep
          tabs on work done on early 20th century African-American and American
          communist literature, and I was lucky enough to assist in a course on
          latin@ literature and intellectual thought. Regarding the novel as a
          generic object of study, I’m interested in theories of the novel,
          histories of the novel, and contemporary attempts to use “distant
          reading” techniques to help better conceptualize this giant object
          called “the novel.”

          More specifically, the way in which geography is plotted in the novel
          remains a top interest of mine. On the one hand, I seek to use
          techniques from human geography in my research, to try and reclaim a
          voice for space alongside history in the novel. On the other hand, I
          am also interested in how quantitative approaches to geography,
          namely through GIS, can also suggest new avenues of literary
          criticism. Though GIS plays a very modest role in my dissertation,
          each chapter’s genesis came from specifically geographical questions
          about how the actions in the novel are spatially distributed.

          Additionally, my interest in community and belonging extends other
          forms of identity expression within groups, such as nationalism. This
          is best expressed in the course I designed and taught in 2008, “Male
          Fantasy Sports”
          ([syllabus](http://moacir.com/pdfs/ENGL-25917_GNDR-21803_syllabus.pdf)),
          where the students and I read theoretical texts on masculinity,
          sexuality, and nationalism before moving to three literary objects
          about baseball and three about football (soccer) in England.

          The literature surrounding English football hooligans, including
          fictional objects about them, fictional objects by them, as well as
          ethnographies and memoirs, continues to appeal to me as a crucible in
          which bubble concerns about the state, empire, individuality, and the
          power and appeal of the collective. Some of these ideas I collected
          into a 2012 article for *The Classical*, called “[Paris is
          Earning](http://theclassical.org/articles/paris-is-earning),” about
          neoliberalism and Parisian football hooligans. While not a work of
          literary criticism, the article shows a possible future line of
          inquiry for me.
