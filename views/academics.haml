        My scholarly interests lie at the intersection of aesthetic production—specifically the 20th and 21st century American novel—political agency, geography, community, (geospatial) digital humanities, geocrticism, and realism.

          I am currently involved in two large-scale academic projects.

          The first project, *Sites in the Novel*, takes the theoretical
          foundation of my dissertation to expand the spatiotemporalities I
          investigate in terms of the realist novel's ability to shape
          political change.  Instead of ascribing a critical method or
          political ideology to the novel from the top down, I argue that the
          novel itself, as a genre featuring a collection of sites, exposes the
          answers it already has at hand within the multi-voiced worlds that
          constitute it. This reframing allows the fundamental trope of
          realism—the metonymic network of relations between objects—to assist
          the reader in finding, in J. K. Gibson-Graham's words, the
          “creativity to generate actual possibilities where none formerly
          existed.” Every novel is a box of revolutionary building blocks,
          waiting for a new construction.

          The project builds upon my readings on American novels of the
          1930s, adding the way in which contemporary novels, especially
          appearing after the emergence of the bricolage politics of Occupy,
          perform and produce object relations within them that can model
          political change in the worlds outside the novel. The aesthetic
          encounter, matched with the interpretive act, can still be political
          today.

          *Making Maps*, the second project, reintroduces geospatial components of
          my scholarly interests to the world-making quality of the novel I pursue
          in *Sites in the Novel*. There are two aims to this project. First, I hope
          to create an epistemological framework that justifies the use of geographical
          information systems/science (GIS) in analysing the content of aesthetic 
          objects. The second aim is to inhabit this productive means of literary
          analysis by modeling the methodology in iteratively reading and analyzing 
          geographically rich American realist novels of the 20th and 21st centuries.

          By building, or, better, creatively *making* tools to help analyze novels, I
          engage in a mixed methods process of production as well as discovery. This way
          I can demonstrate the process of iterative reading, where a small question is
          posed and answered, which then yields new questions. The GIS is tasked with new
          challenges, and the text enjoys tighter relationships with the reader.

          My years of work in the field of information technology has inspired
          me to see in what ways that experience can inform my scholarly work,
          meaning I have found a lot of like-minded scholars in the digital
          humanities community, especially in the realms of geospatial digital
          humanities. 

          I was the first graduate student in the humanities at Chicago to enroll in the year-long course on geographical information systems/science (GIS), and I have tried to use that training where possible in my literary analysis. This experience also led to invitations to two events funded by
          the National Endowment of the Humanities, the [Institute for Enabling
          Geospatial Scholarship](http://spatial.scholarslab.org/about) at the University of Virginia and the workshop
          [“Visualizing Flow and Movement in the Humanities”](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=HD-51228-11) at the University
          of Redlands. At both events, I worked with scholars in both digital
          humanities and GIS to imagine specific applications of GIS to
          humanistic work. 
          
          In April 2014, I presented some of my own work in GIS
          at the “Telling Stories with Maps” seminar at the University of
          Birmingham’s Digital Humanities Hub ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz58tmCl8TQ)). Similarly, I presided over a special session I developed, “[Geocritical Explorations inside the Text](http://www.mla.org/program_details?prog_id=344&year=2015),” for the 130th 
          Annual MLA Convention in Vancouver ([more info](/talks/mla-15-geocritical-explorations-inside-the-text)).

          In the future, I aim to help design software that make geospatial analysis
          of aesthetic objects even easier.

          “The Site of the Novel: Objects in American Realism, 1930–1940”
          ([abstract
          pdf](http://moacir.com/pdfs/MoacirPdeSaPereira-dissertation-abstract.pdf))
          is the name of the dissertation I wrote and defended in January 2014
          under the direction of [Lauren
          Berlant](http://english.uchicago.edu/faculty/berlant) and [Kenneth W.
          Warren](http://english.uchicago.edu/faculty/warren). The dissertation
          sits at the intersection of my interests in:

          * **Early 20th century American realist novels**. I am writing
          about James T. Farrell’s *Studs Lonigan* trilogy, John Dos
          Passos’s *U.S.A.*, Ernest Hemingway’s *For Whom the Bell Tolls*,
          and Sinclair Lewis’s *It Can’t Happen Here*. Each work engages
          with radical and communist politics of the early 20th century.

          * **(Human) geography and quantitative literary criticism**. All
          these works are very closely attached to the real world, and I have
          been able to collect data about the geographies constructed in the
          worlds of the novels. Using techniques from GIS and approaching the
          works geographically / spatially drew out questions about more
          fundamental ways in which the novel works.

          * **Belonging and community**. The works I investigate feature human
          characters that often blend into their surroundings, either becoming
          part of a larger human community or hanging together as part of a
          larger site of human and nonhuman objects.

          * **Realism as a literary genre and realism as a philosophical
          ontology**. As the notions of individual (or character) and community
          (of objects) become more and more inter-related while still
          independent, it becomes impossible to maintain a human-centric,
          correlationist account of the worlds within literature.

          * **Non-scalar and affective accounts of relations**. Entities like
          communities, characters and their surroundings become considerable as
          proper “sites,” with their own internal relationships that can be
          occasionally rhythmically stratifying and occasionally unpredictably
          deterritorializing, reforming the object of the site. As the
          component objects keep agitating each other they imply from another
          direction the necessity of a non-human, site-based literary
          criticism.

          * **Metonymy and chronotopes**. A non-human, site-based literary
          criticism forces humans, characters, texts, worlds in texts, and the
          like into a heteroglottic cacophony of objects—all real, all
          metonymically (as opposed to metaphorically) connected. Furthermore,
          the worlds in novels are chronotopically connected to the worlds in
          which the novels are written, as the author and reader are both
          influenced by the specific chronotopes of their own sites.

          * **Counterfactual worlds and alternatives to neoliberalism**. The
          specific chronotopes of the novels influence the worlds in which they
          exist as well, meaning every realist novel permits, in J. K.
          Gibson-Graham’s
          [words](http://law.uvic.ca/demcon/victoria_colloquium/documents/gibson_2008_progress_paper.pdf),
          the “creativity to generate actual possibilities where none formerly
          existed.” Every novel, hence, is a box of revolutionary building
          blocks.

        :markdown
          Beyond what gets sufficient coverage in my dissertation, there are a
          wider set of interests that circulate around those key themes. I keep
          tabs on work done on early 20th century African-American and American
          communist literature, and I was lucky enough to assist in a course on
          latin@ literature and intellectual thought. Regarding the novel as a
          generic object of study, I’m interested in theories of the novel,
          histories of the novel, and contemporary attempts to use “distant
          reading” techniques to help better conceptualize this giant object
          called “the novel.”

          More specifically, the way in which geography is plotted in the novel
          remains a top interest of mine. On the one hand, I seek to use
          techniques from human geography in my research, to try and reclaim a
          voice for space alongside history in the novel. On the other hand, I
          am also interested in how quantitative approaches to geography,
          namely through GIS, can also suggest new avenues of literary
          criticism. Though GIS plays a very modest role in my dissertation,
          each chapter’s genesis came from specifically geographical questions
          about how the actions in the novel are spatially distributed.

          Additionally, my interest in community and belonging extends other
          forms of identity expression within groups, such as nationalism. This
          is best expressed in the course I designed and taught in 2008, “Male
          Fantasy Sports”
          ([syllabus](http://moacir.com/pdfs/ENGL-25917_GNDR-21803_syllabus.pdf)),
          where the students and I read theoretical texts on masculinity,
          sexuality, and nationalism before moving to three literary objects
          about baseball and three about football (soccer) in England.

          The literature surrounding English football hooligans, including
          fictional objects about them, fictional objects by them, as well as
          ethnographies and memoirs, continues to appeal to me as a crucible in
          which bubble concerns about the state, empire, individuality, and the
          power and appeal of the collective. Some of these ideas I collected
          into a 2012 article for *The Classical*, called “[Paris is
          Earning](http://theclassical.org/articles/paris-is-earning),” about
          neoliberalism and Parisian football hooligans. While not a work of
          literary criticism, the article shows a possible future line of
          inquiry for me.
