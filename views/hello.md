Hello.
------

I am a scholar of literature & space. My research focus is on how digital
techniques can elucidate novels of the 20th & 21st centuries, expressing
itself in my digital coding and collaboration projects. I have taught in the
[Department of English](http://english.fas.nyu.edu/page/home) at New York
University. I am also a member of the [Group for Experimental Methods in the
Humanities](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in) at Columbia.
