Hello.
------

I am a scholar of literature & space, focusing on the way digital techniques
can help elucidate novels of the 20th and 21st centuries. This focus expresses
itself in my team projects, scholarship, and teaching in the [Department of
English](http://english.fas.nyu.edu/page/home) at New York University.
