Hello.
------

 I am a scholar of literature & space, which I study and teach as Assistant
 Professor / Faculty Fellow in the [Department of
 English](http://english.fas.nyu.edu/page/home) at [New York
 University](http://www.nyu.edu). My general focus is novels of the 20th and
 21st centuries, and I use digital techniques to investigate them.
