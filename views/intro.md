 I am a scholar of literature & space as well as Assistant Professor / Faculty
 Fellow in the [Department of English](http://english.fas.nyu.edu/page/home)
 at [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu).  I received my PhD from the
 [Department of English Language and Literature](http://english.uchicago.edu)
 at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu) in 2014. My general
 focus is novels of the 20th and 21st centuries, and I use digital techniques
 to investigate them.
