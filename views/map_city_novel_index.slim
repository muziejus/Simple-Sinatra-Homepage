h2#description Course description

p What is the relationship between the city and the novel? A century ago, the
  pioneers of American sociology in Chicago often looked to literature for
  inspiration. Later authors returned the favor in showing sociological influ-
  ences in their own urban imaginations. This class returns to this old push and
  pull with a distinct, contemporary spin. Three units—one on reading about
  the city, one on reading novels about the city, and one on making maps of the
  city as revealed in the novels—make up the semester and push us toward our
  goal of visualizing what the relationships between city and novel were, are,
  and could be. The maps we make will be digital, but no previous experience in
  programming or mapping is required. Students will learn everything during the
  semester, and they will be able to make their own maps and draw spatial
  conclusions about textual works for their final projects. The novels we read
  will be American works of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and they
  will focus geographically on the U.S. as well. The early sociological texts
  will be supplemented by more contemporary writings on the city as well as
  texts from the digital mapping debates in the field of geography.
