Research
--------

My scholarly activity circles around the way literature and space are
intertwined, specifically in American novels of the 20th and 21st centuries. I
am particularly interested in novels that describe the experience of
geographical (and, additionally, affective) change brought on by immigration
or migration. I use the tool I wrote,
[_NYWalker_](http://nywalker.newyorkscapes.org), to collect geographical data
on the novels I investigate.
