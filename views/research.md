Research
--------

My scholarly activity circles around the book-length project I am preparing,
*Making Maps: Mixed Methods and Everyday Criticism*. In it, I argue for the
possibilities of a mixed methods approach in widening opportunities for the
digital humanities.  I then use this methodology to iteratively read and
geographically analyze novels of the 20th and 21st centuries.
