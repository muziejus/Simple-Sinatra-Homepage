Scholarship
-----------

My scholarly activity currently circles around the book-length project I am
preparing, *Making Maps: Mixed Methods and Everyday Criticism*. Two aims guide
the project. First, I argue for the possibilities of a mixed methods approach
in widening opportunities for the digital humanities in English departments.
Second, I use this methodology to iteratively read and geographically analyze
novels of the 20th and 21st centuries.
