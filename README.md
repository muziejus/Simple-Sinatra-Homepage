simple-sinatra-homepage
=======================

This is what the source code for [moacir.com](http://moacir.com) looks
like. It might not be the prettiest code in the world, but it does what
I want to.

All that is excluded is my Wordpress install
([/donkeyhottie](http://moacir.com/donkeyhottie/)) and the
[Azuro](http://fontfeed.com/archives/azuro-a-new-typeface-for-reading-on-screens/)
font that I have no right to distribute. And I guess a ton of other
files I have lying about that don't help the site any.

One of the neat things this webpage does, imo, (though it confuses
robots) is that it works with Sinatra and JavaScript to change the URL
based on what drop-down menus are visible. I discuss how I implemented
that [in this blog
post](http://moacir.com/donkeyhottie/2012/04/12/sinatra-gets-all-jazzed-up-with-splats/).
It probably breaks some kind of good web-governance stuff, but what do I
know.
